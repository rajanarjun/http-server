# HTTP server in C
This is a lightweight HTTP server implemented in C for the purpose of learning C language and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

#### Why re-invent the wheel?
This project gives an understanding of the HTTP protocol and RFC standards; how requests and responses are handled, low-level communication between "server" and "client". Helps learn fundamental concepts in C and programming in general; memory management, string parsing/manipulation, defensive programming (ensuring that requests do not allow dangerous path traversal, such as "../server\_root"), network/socket programming, and multi-threading/concurrency.

#### Current implementation:
- Supports HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1
- Handles GET requests
- Serves static files (HTML, .jpg, .png, etc)
- Custom error pages

#### Future implementation to include:
- Basic logging
- Handling concurrent connections
- Multi-threaded request handling

#### Directory Stucture:
To be added.

#### Prequisites:
- GCC or Clang compiler
- Make
 
#### Build Instructions:
To be added.

#### Running the server:
To be added.
